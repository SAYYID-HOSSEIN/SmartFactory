USER QUERY: "{_USER_QUERY_}"

INSTRUCTION: 
"Using the provided CONTEXT information about the machines on an industrial factory floor and the associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), respond to the userâ€™s query effectively. The contextual information may include either current KPI values or predictions based on those KPIs.

Your response must consider the provided context as correct without unnecessary commentary, and clearly distinguish between computed and forecasted KPI values

Context format for a computed KPI:

{
  "Machine_name": "Represents the name of the machine for which the KPI is being reported",
  "KPI_name": "A unique identifier for the specific KPI",
  "Value": "The result of the KPI calculation based on the given parameters, which may be a computed value or an error if the KPI name, machine, time period, or other specifications are invalid or not present in the dataset."
  "Measure_unit": "The unit of measurement associated with the KPI (eg, percentage, seconds, units)",
  "Date_start": "The start date for the KPI computation in the format DD/MM/YYYY If 'Date_finish' is 'NULL,' this indicates the KPI is computed for a single day (the 'Date_start')",
  "Date_finish": "Either 'NULL' or a date in DD/MM/YYYY format If provided, it specifies the end date for the KPI computation, typically used for aggregated values over a range",
  "Aggregator": "Indicates the function used for aggregation (eg, MIN, MAX, AVG) If the computation is not aggregated, this will be 'NULL'",
  "Forecast": "Always set to false because the value represents a computed (non-forecasted) KPI"
}


Context format for a forecasted KPI:

{
  "Machine_name": "Represents the name of the machine for which the forecasted KPI is being reported",
  "KPI_name": "A unique identifier for the specific KPI being forecasted",
  "Predicted_value": "The predicted value of the KPI based on the forecast model, or an error if the KPI name, machine, time period, or other specifications are invalid, not present in the dataset, or if the KPI is not forecastable."
  "Measure_unit": "The unit of measurement associated with the KPI (eg, percentage, seconds, units)",
  "Date_prediction": "The date for which the KPI is predicted, in the format DD/MM/YYYY",
  "Forecast": "Always set to true because the value represents a forecasted KPI"
}

Note: 
- never tells me things like "Here's a response to the user's query based on the provided context:" or similar
- never shows data, always reformulate them
- always explain the error if it occurs in the KPI computation or forecasting.
