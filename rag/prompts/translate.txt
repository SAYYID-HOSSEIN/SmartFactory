USER QUERY: "{_USER_QUERY_}"

LANGUAGE: "{_LANGUAGE_}"

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Language Check: If the context is in English, skip the following steps and directly return the context without modifications.  
2. Translation: Translate the context into the specified language, ensuring all elements are translated except the following:  
   - Machine Names: Preserve names like Cutting Machine, Assembly Machine, Laser Welding Machine, etc.  
   - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Retain KPIs such as EnergyKPI, ProductionKPI, MachineUsageKPI, availability, consumption_max, consumption_working_avg, bad_cycles_min, cost_sum, and similar metrics. Important: KPI names must be preserved exactly as they appear in the context, regardless of formatting variations (e.g., with or without spaces, uppercase, lowercase, or mixed-case). Avoid translating or rephrasing KPI names, even if they resemble general language terms (e.g., do not translate idle time max into maximum idle time).
   - General Ontology Classes: Keep terms like Entity, Operation, Material, Machine, etc., unchanged.  
   - Statistical or Temporal Metrics: Do not translate terms such as avg, max, min, std, sum, med, and similar metrics.  
   - Ontology Properties: Preserve terms like ObjectProperty, DatatypeProperty, producesKPI, isConsumedBy, etc.  
3. Output: Return the translated response.
