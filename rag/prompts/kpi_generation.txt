- Atomic: a boolean value that represent if the KPI formula is atomic or it requires other KPIs to be computed (eg: false)
- Description: Brief text description that represent what the KPI compute (eg: This indicator calculates the energy efficiency of a specific machine in a given time interval)
- Formula (base): the basic formula of the KPI (power_consumption_efficiency = working_time_sum / consumption_sum)
