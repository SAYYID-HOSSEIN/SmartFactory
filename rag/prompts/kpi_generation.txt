- description: Brief explanation of what the KPI measures (e.g., "This indicator calculates the energy efficiency of a specific machine in a given time interval.").  
- formula: Basic formula used for the KPI (e.g., "power_consumption_efficiency = working_time_sum / consumption_sum").  
- unit_measure: Unit of measure associated with the KPI (e.g., %, kW, m).  
- atomic: Boolean indicating if the KPI is atomic (true) or derived using other KPIs (false).
